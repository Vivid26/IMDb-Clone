# IMDb-Clone

A simple IMDb clone website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No Javascript library is used.

In this project, you will find my own version of IMDb using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Functionally, this website will display a list of movies that are now playing in theaters and allow the user to search for movies by the movie name.



## **Objectives**
Upon the completion of this project, I am able to:
- Describe the mechanics of displaying dynamic data on a webpage.
- Use an API to query for data and manipulate them based on your use case.

- [ ]  Demonstrate CSS styling on various elements, including but not limited to:
